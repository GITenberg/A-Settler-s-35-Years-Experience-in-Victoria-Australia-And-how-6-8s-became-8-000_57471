<p>In giving this little "Life Sketch," I am actuated by a desire to
assist many, not only hard-handed men in the "Old Country," but many
soft-handed ones also, as I was, and especially those who have large
families, as I had, and who are struggling for a living, and see
but little hope for the future in the already over-crowded hive in
the "Old Land," and a still poorer prospect for the new swarms; I,
therefore, think a little advice and encouragement to those desirous to
"cast off," from one who has been through it all, will be welcomed by
many.&mdash;E.H.</p>

HEN living in the "Old Land," over 35 years since, I belonged to a
class of which there are many thousands&mdash;a struggling professor&mdash;and
of the class I have designated as "soft-handed." I was an artist by
profession; studied from a child; never did anything else; and in
1850 and 1851 had so far advanced in my profession to have the honor
of having my works hung in a creditable position on the walls of the
Royal Academy of Arts, of which I was also a student. I married rather
young (at 25), and soon had little ones running round. I started fairly
well in the neighborhood of London, at Clapham, adding teaching. Just
about this time (1847) artists were invited by the Government to
send in specimens of their works for exhibition in Westminster Hall,
for competition for the decoration of the new Houses of Parliament,
then just finished. I was rather too young and inexperienced an
artist for so great and honored an undertaking; however, I thought I
would venture. I got my large picture finished, but from over-study,
excitement, and anxiety, my health gave way. I contracted nervous
typhus fever, and consequently could not finish the other one, which
was required by the Commissioners to enable me to compete. But Sir
Chas. Eastlake, the President, whose letter I still have, said my
painting&mdash;under the section of "Scriptural Allegory," subject, "The
King of Kings and Lord of Lords"&mdash;though not entitled to compete,
could, if I liked, be hung in the vestibule of the hall; which was an
honor I gladly consented to.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>On getting up from my long and dangerous illness, my medical advisers
persuaded me to go to a milder climate for perfect restoration, and
to give up my profession for a time; at least, to do but very little
painting. South Devonshire was recommended. We therefore left our
home at Clapham, and took up our residence about four miles from that
lovely spot, Torquay. To our residence was attached a small farm and
a splendid orchard. In this beautiful climate I soon regained my
strength. I did all sorts of labor on the farm, so that I got a general
insight into all sorts of farming work. This I have found exceedingly
useful since taking to farming in Australia.</p>

<p>I found many kind friends in Devonshire. (I cannot help naming the
Savile family. God bless them for their kind patronage and introduction
in my profession!) We resided in Devonshire about four years. We then
came again to London, but found a difficulty in looking up a connection
again; had to fill up my time in decorating in the various courts of
the Crystal Palace, at Sydenham, just then being erected. I, however,
saw but little prospect of advancing in my profession, or even making a
living, and less prospect for a large and increasing family; we having
by this time seven children, six boys and one baby girl; besides, I
had contracted a great taste for a rural life while in Devonshire. We
determined, therefore, to depart for Australia&mdash;the land of gold! The
goldfields being at that time in full swing. A wide field indeed for
enterprise, and anticipated prosperity, with God's blessing; for, I am
happy to say, I had long sought His grace and guidance, and committed
my ways unto Him, and was sure He would guide our steps.</p>

<p>In the first place, I applied to the Commissioners of Emigration
for a situation as schoolmaster for the voyage, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> a Government
emigration ship; my wife to act as matron. I presented letters of
recommendation&mdash;one from the Bishop of London (Blomfield). I was well
known to him, as Fulham, near London, where he resided, was my native
place. The commissioners said my letters were more than enough, but
desired to know the number of children I had. On hearing the number
they informed me that they regretted to say that, according to their
regulations, this would be a bar to my appointment. Three, I think, was
the number allowed.</p>

<p>This was a great blow to us, as we should have saved our passage money,
and had a salary besides; I think about £150 as schoolmaster, and wife
as matron. Parties told me I could have managed it if I had liked, by
getting some of the passengers to take the other four children; but
this I could not do from principle. To pay our passage in a general
passage ship, therefore, exhausted all our little means.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="Farewell_to_Dear_Old_England" id="Farewell_to_Dear_Old_England">Farewell to Dear Old England.</a></p>


<p>We did intend taking our passage in the new ship "Schomberg," just
launched, and owned by "The White Star Company." On enquiring at
the London office, they informed me that I could send our goods on
to Liverpool, but they would not be put on board any ship until our
passage money was paid, and that I should find them in the company's
warehouse in Liverpool; consequently, I sent the goods on. We could
not, however, get ready to go by the "Schomberg." On arriving at
Liverpool, and enquiring for our luggage, I found it had been sent on
in that vessel.</p>

<p>Now, the fate of that fine new ship, I presume, is generally known. The
captain had a bet with the captain of the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> "Kent," a well known
clipper, and declared "if he did not beat the 'Kent,' he would knock
her ('the Schomberg's') bows in." On hearing that the "Kent" had made
the passage before him, the "Schomberg" was wilfully run on shore, just
a little way from Cape Otway. Luckily, it was fair weather, and the
passengers and crew were taken safely off, but with only the luggage
they could carry in their hands; there being only just standing room
on board the rescuing steamboat. The "Schomberg" became a total wreck.
This, I suppose, is one of the most wicked and shameful incidents
that ever happened on the shores of Australia. We took our passage in
the next ship; the good ship "Sultana," from Liverpool, on the 21st
October, 1855.</p>

<p>I remember, as we weighed anchor, being some distance out in the
stream, and out of hearing of any friendly cheer, a serious calm
appeared to pervade the ship; all appeared absorbed with their own
thoughts, when we found the ship was under way, more by the apparent
moving of the receding shore; she being a sailing vessel. I don't know
the feelings of the other passengers; possibly many were like our own,
at departing from the good "Old Land." Hitherto, we had borne up well
in parting from kindred and friends. We said "Good-bye" in London; but
now, in those few calm moments, seated upon the ship's deck, with wife,
six sons, and a baby girl around us, we felt the necessity of faith
in that good Providence on Whom we had cast the future. Our feelings,
however, would have vent in a few hot tears, but these had to be
brushed quickly on one side.</p>

<p>I do not think it necessary in this little sketch to give a long
account of our voyage, or the various incidents that happened. There
was nothing very sensational; our worst experience was our first night
out. The ship was so crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> that there were not berths enough, and,
as we came late on board, ours had to be erected, so that we had to
huddle down between decks, the best we could. The children being
our great care, there was no rest for wife or self. We had fearful
weather in the Channel, and, everything being loose on board, the
din was fearful; the heavy iron cable on deck rolling from side to
side, and the ship's bell tolling at every roll of the ship, and the
carpenters working all night, fitting up berths, and the state of
the passengers&mdash;one can guess the confusion! And what added to it
more&mdash;just as we reached the most dangerous part of the Channel, off
the coast of Ireland, the tug-hawser parted, but, when pulled on board,
it evidently had been cut adrift with an axe&mdash;a most shameful act.
The contract was to take us clear of the Channel. This, then, made
further trouble, as all hands had now to set to and work the ship, and
there was great danger in working her out of the difficult position
she was left in, and anxiously did all wait for the morning. It may be
imagined that the whole of the voyage was no pleasure trip for wife or
self, in a crowded ship, and seven children (under 12 years of age)
to look after. Neither do I think the children liked it; they were
too young, and they did not thrive at all on the rough ship's fare,
particularly the hard ship's biscuits&mdash;they could not manage them at
all. After a time, though, we got on better; I had a carpenter's plane
with my goods, and we shaved the biscuits down on that, and made it
into puddings, and so managed to get rid of them in this way. The plane
went the round of the ship after this, particularly among the old
people. We had, however, on arriving at Melbourne, an American cask
full, unconsumed; these we took on shore with us, and they went fine in
soups, &amp;c., with good Australian beef, at 3d. a pound.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="Melbourne_at_Last" id="Melbourne_at_Last">Melbourne, at Last.</a></p>


<p>We were thankful to arrive safely, after a fine passage of 81 days.
We arrived off Cape Otway in the night, and stood "off and on" until
daylight, when the pilot came on board, and the first thing he told us
was the loss of the "Schomberg." Well, of course, we then knew also
that all our goods were at the bottom of the sea. We were thankful,
though, that we did not ship on board that ill-fated vessel; but ought
we to attribute her loss to <i>fate</i>? No! It was wilful wickedness. I
regretted our loss the more as my Westminster Hall picture was among
the things lost, as it was the highest class work I ever attempted.</p>

<p>It was with anxious eyes myself and several other heads of families
viewed the shore of the "promised land." It certainly (from the deck
of the vessel) did not look very prepossessing; not even with a good
glass, and more particularly as we went up the bay nearer to Melbourne.
It being the dry season&mdash;January&mdash;nothing looked green, and the dry
grass looked more like sand, and the trees looked stunted. It was a hot
wind and dust storm on the day we landed, and the place looked very
dreary; what few shops there were, were nearly closed to keep out the
dust. We were brought up the Yarra River to Melbourne from the ship by
steam tugs. Of course, most of us had on our "Old Country" clothes;
it was quite easy to know a "New Chum." I don't remember seeing a
belltopper hat, or a coat, being worn in Melbourne at that time, and
"New Chums" hated to be conspicuous, as they were always "Joed," that
they soon dropped their "Old Country" style, and took to jumpers and
straw, or slouched felt hats. The highest style, however, was the
cabbage-tree hat. I had carefully preserved a nearly new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> belltopper
hat through the voyage, but somehow had forgotten it in the bustle
of leaving. The last I saw of it, however, it was being kicked about
on the other lighter as a football, which I did not after regret.
There were several parties with large families on board. The head of
one, who had been on shore to look round for a few hours, and had
been a schoolmaster, took charge of the women and children (about 30
children), and conducted them to a place he had seen&mdash;"the Wesleyan
Home"&mdash;about a mile and a quarter from the landing place, leaving
myself and the other males to look after the luggage, and follow on
with the drays. It was after dark when we arrived at the "home." It
was a pleasant sight to see the dear children sitting round the table
enjoying their tea and nice "soft tack" (bread, &amp;c.), after roughing it
so long on board ship.</p>

<p>"The Wesleyan Emigrants' Home"&mdash;I believe it is still in existence;
it was a few years since&mdash;was a fine institution, and a great boon
to emigrants. It was a peaceful, christian home, and the only one, I
think, at that time. Hotels and restaurants were the resort of the
lowest characters, and hardly safe for anyone to enter; most people in
them went armed, and fearful scenes took place.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="Christian_Socialism" id="Christian_Socialism">Christian Socialism.</a></p>


<p>The manager of the "home" had a book, in which he entered the names of
all who lodged there. He also entered your nationality and religion;
also denomination. When he put the last question to me, I answered, "A
Christian Brother." "Why," said he, "yours is the first entry I have
made in my book of such a sect." "Sect!" I replied, "I did not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> it
was a sect at all." I hoped not, for I had adopted it in opposition to
sectarianism, of which I had seen so much evil in the "Old Country."
I therefore determined to drop "isms" in the sea, and, on arriving at
this new and good land, hoped to be known simply as a christian, and
"give the right hand of fellowship to all who loved the Lord Jesus
in sincerity and truth," irrespective of denominations. I regret,
however, that the old animosities have reached this new land. The old
bickerings and trifles, non-essentials, about "Apostolic Succession,"
"Dipping or Sprinkling," "Free-will," "Election," "Reprobation,"
&amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;neglecting the more paramount matters, "Belief," and a
"consistent walk in life." But now, at this time (1891), I am glad to
see a growing desire for unity and christian socialism in Victoria,
and more particularly in the country districts; and I think they are
setting an example to the towns, where there is a sad want of unity
among the clergy, and christian socialism among the people. The
congregations even are divided into "sets," or, as the Yankee would
call them, "grades," who "stand off" from each other, and think it
quite condescending, in any way, to recognise the lower "set." The
visitations, also, of the clergy, are in very many cases confined to
the higher "grades." There are, though, a few grand exceptions. Now,
all this should be broken down if the church is ever to take its true
place in the world. We should rather begin at the bottom&mdash;with men of
low estate&mdash;for, hath not God chosen such? In my long life I have found
the best traits of character among the poor. Verily, many that we think
last shall stand first on <i>that day</i>. In my humble opinion, nothing
will tend to overthrow the sceptical and atheistical tendencies of the
age so much as christian fellowship and brotherhood; in fact, it is
the want of this, with the dissensions and bickerings of professors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
which create this scepticism; and this will continue until the world
can say of christians of to-day, as it was said of old, "See how these
christians love each other." "Dearly beloved brethren" will then not
only be upon the lips, but in the heart. I must, however, stop this
homilistical strain, and return to my narrative.</p>

<p>I stepped on shore in Melbourne, with my dear wife and seven children,
with the grand sum of <i>ten shillings</i> in my pocket; but, with a stout
heart and willing hands, and a firm reliance on God's blessings,
things did not appear so very hard. We stayed two or three days at the
"Wesleyan home." On the second day after landing I got work, digging
potatoes at 14s. per day. We then rented a small two-roomed house in
Collingwood; had our boxes, at first, for furniture; but the grand
wages of fourteen shillings per day soon provided what other little
furniture we required. It appeared a poor home, though, after the style
of the "Old Country;" but it is astonishing how soon one gets over this
feeling, where love and happiness reign. I am not a believer in that
foolish saying, that "when want comes in at the door, love flies out of
the window." No; true hearts cling the tighter.</p>

<p>On looking round Melbourne, I found some few parties I knew in England.
They were very old settlers long before the discovery of gold; they
were in affluent circumstances. They kindly gave me a commission to
paint a few portraits in oils, which led to one or two more. I also
painted a few fancy pictures. The colony, however, was too young to
appreciate the <i>fine</i> arts to any extent. The <i>rougher</i> arts were more
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> vogue, and the gold fever was not abated. I also got a touch of it,
my wife having two brothers on the Ovens diggings, who had been in the
colony about a year. I determined, therefore, to join them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="Off_to_the_Diggings" id="Off_to_the_Diggings">Off to the Diggings.</a></p>


<p>I started alone with swag, blankets, billy, pannikin, etc., in orthodox
style, for a 200 miles' tramp through the bush. (See frontispiece.)
This, however, was not much of an undertaking for me, as I was a great
pedestrian, could do my six miles an hour easy, and often over 50 miles
per day on my sketching tours in the "Old Country;" being tall (fully
six feet), I had a good stride. At that time the Sydney Road was only
formed a few miles out of Melbourne, and from the Rockey Waterholes to
the foot of the Big Hill (commonly then called Pretty Sally's Hill) was
swamp ground. I found a difficulty in getting over this; I had to tread
the thistles down for miles to prevent bogging, and it was raining
fast. The contractors were just forming the road, and on the first
rise on the other side of the swamp the camp was formed. The men had
knocked off on account of the rain. Just as I was level with the camp,
I heard my name called out in true Irish accent, and out ran one of our
shipmates to greet me. He occupied the next berth to us on board ship,
and was ill a great part of the way. He had been a tradesman in Dublin.
He was lively enough now, as he grasped my hand and cut a real Irish
caper, with "Hurrah! for Australia and 14s. a day, and wood and water!"
He was driving one of the contractor's drays. He wanted me to stay, as
it was far into the afternoon, but no&mdash;my alloted mileage was not done,
so I marched on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>My first night's "bushing" was a strange experience. Rolled up in
blankets, at the foot of a gum tree, I had not turned <i>down</i> long (I
cannot say turned <i>in</i>) when I was conscious of something being upon my
shoulder, and, cautiously turning round, saw an animal perched quite
innocently there. It was an opossum. I presume he did not recognise
me from a log. He appeared quite content to sit there until I gave
him a cant, and sent him some distance off. This "camping out" is
not at all an unpleasant experience, as many might think, and this
was a splendid moonlight night. At that time it was far more safe to
keep clear of restaurants and shanties, as they were the resort of
the vilest characters. Neither was it safe to camp out alone with a
fire at night, as this was an attraction, and you were pretty sure to
get objectionable company. The plan, therefore, generally adopted,
was to boil the billy for tea, then, after tea, leave, and go on a
little distance in the dark, and turn off the road or track into the
silent bush, and roll up in your blankets; thus you avoided unpleasant
company. I got through in about seven days. I passed through the famous
"Woolshed Diggings," where the rich claims were, and where the men
had to wash the gold off their boots when they left work. There was a
"strike" on just then. The claim-holders wanted to reduce the wages to
£1 per day. I was interviewed, and offered work at that price, but,
of course, I refused, as I was on my way to join my wife's brothers.
I then went on through Beechworth&mdash;Spring Creek diggings. The scenes
on the diggings were strange and novel to me. Beechworth was the chief
centre of the mining district, and the other diggings around were named
by the distance from Beechworth, thus&mdash;"The One Mile," "The Three
Mile," and "The Nine Mile." This last was my destination. It was also
called "Snake Valley," from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> winding course of the creek. It was
late in the evening when I arrived, quite dark and pouring rain, and
there had been a long rain before, so that the roads in the township
were wretched. At the crossings of the creek it was impassable, and
was only indicated by side logs, on which I had to crawl. The worst
of it was, I had to wander up and down the creek to find my brothers'
hut. The storekeepers knew them by sight, but could not say where they
lived. I was directed to a large restaurant, about a mile down the
creek. There were about 40 diggers, just at tea. I walked up and down
between the tables, and I think they were the finest, strongest, and
roughest set of men I ever saw. I did not see my brothers, though. Came
back, enquired at the police camp, also to no purpose. Over the creek
again, when at last I found a butcher who pointed out on the bank, on
the other side of the creek, the light shining through the calico top
of their hut. He lent me a piece of candle to cross the creek with, and
I managed to work my way among the holes and sludge, etc., to the other
side. And glad I was to get there, and I was as "wet as a rat," and
pretty well tired out. I soon got "a shift" however, and such a fire as
they had I never saw before; enough to roast a bullock; at which also I
got a good roasting; and after a good supper of beef, damper and tea,
soon felt all right. This for my first tramp in Australia.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="Ten_Years_on_the_Diggings" id="Ten_Years_on_the_Diggings">Ten Years on the Diggings.</a></p>


<p>I joined my brothers in their claim, and we had two other mates, making
a party of five. We were driving out wash-dirt, and sluicing it in long
boxes with the creek water. We did fairly well&mdash;made from £6 to £7
per week for each man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> This year (1856) was an exceedingly wet one,
particularly in the winter and early spring. This drove the miners, out
of shallow sinking, and the great "Woolshed Diggings" (Read's Creek)
were flooded out, and thousands rushed the shallow sluicing ground of
the Nine-mile Creek; in consequence, there was great trouble about
water, and "water rights," which caused endless litigation. The creek
could not supply half the water required; therefore, all the hills
for miles round were tunneled for water, and an astonishing number
of springs were opened. These were recognised by the Mining Warden
as independent&mdash;independent of the creek&mdash;and a permit given for the
sole use of the same. Many of these cost hundreds of pounds to cut. It
was also called "created water;" that is, water before locked up in
the hills, and not feeding the creek. The creek water was available
to all, but this would not command one-thousandth part of the mining
ground. Our party, therefore, looked about for indications of springs,
by sinking trial shafts, and then driving tunnels. We were fortunate
in tapping water. This we conducted to dams, and used for sluicing
purposes in shallow ground, from 3ft. to 10ft. deep, washing away the
whole of it.</p>

<p>I could not rest long with my family remaining in Melbourne, as some
of the children had colonial fever; a very distressing complaint, but
not very fatal. Most "new chums" had it at that time, but I don't hear
anything of it now. Therefore, I tramped down to Melbourne and back
twice during the first year to see them; the last time to bring them
up; so that during my first year in Australia I walked about 1000
miles. The last time I was over two months in Melbourne, as our eighth
child was near at hand, and I thought it my duty to be with them. I
filled up my time in Melbourne decorating the new Legislative Chambers,
just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> then finished. My wages were just about the same as what I was
getting in the claim, viz., £6 to £7 per week&mdash;good wages too; but not
high for that class of work. Masons at that time got over £1 per day.
I then started with the wife and family in the arduous duty of taking
them 200 miles through the bush in an American waggon. We were 20
days on the road. It is now done in about six hours per rail. We had
a fearful time on "Pretty Sally's Hill" (before mentioned); it blew
a gale with heavy rain. It would have blown our tent clean away had
I not "turned out" and cut saplings down and logged it all round. We
pitched our tent every night, and had a long picnicing all the way. We
could only procure milk at one place (Benalla) the whole 200 miles. We
went per coach from Beechworth to the Nine Mile; had to place all the
children in the bottom to prevent them being pitched out, the roads
being so rough, and hills all the way. Glad, indeed, were we (dear
wife, in particular, with baby) to arrive at our digger's home. I had
previously erected the sides and skeleton of our future residence,
and had only to put the calico top on, and stretch the fly roof.
The sides were made of split slabs, the plates and rafters trimmed
saplings, so that it took us, with the assistance of our mates, only
a few hours to get it ready for occupying. It was very cold up there
in the winter. I think the altitude is over 3000 feet. I often had to
"turn out" in the night to shake the snow off the fly roof. We managed
to keep nice and warm, though, with the huge logs on the fire&mdash;the
fire-place almost as wide as the hut. It took two men to roll some of
the back-logs in, and the fire was kept burning all night. In a few
years we put up a better residence. Sawn timber for the frame, shingle
top and a verandah; and we started a good garden from the very first,
and were the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> to introduce fruit trees in the district. Mine was
the second formed garden on the Creek, and out of which we made many a
pound in vegetables&mdash;sold cabbages at sixpence per pound. Had splendid
flowers also. I likewise introduced the watercress, and had a sale for
them even in Beechworth. They grew to perfection with our spring water
running over the beds. The boys carried them round among the miners,
and they were greatly appreciated. This was long before the Chinamen
thought of gardening (which they monopolize now), and there were about
4000 of them then on the Nine Mile.</p>

<p>I will not dwell long on our life on the diggings. I was not a "lucky
digger," with the exception of one little patch (which see particulars
further on). We lived, however, a comfortable, happy, healthy, and a
very independent life, and brought up a large family&mdash;they now had
increased to eleven, seven boys and four girls. This ten years on the
diggings was, by far, the longest rest down, up to then, of our married
life. For instance, of our seven children born in England, not two
were born in one house; here, in our digger's home, we had three in
addition, one being also born in Melbourne. It will be imagined that
by this time I had worn off all my "smooth-handedness." Yes, indeed, I
had become a "horny-handed" working man, and considered it no disgrace
either.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">If the laborer be true."</span><br />
</p>

<p>I worked like a navvy for ten years, through many hardships and danger.
I had two narrow escapes in falling banks of earth&mdash;had my pick caught
each time, and buried as I was dragging it in running out of the way
of the fall. I had also, during the first year, a very narrow escape
of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> buried alive, working underground when the ground was rotten
and dangerous from the continued wet, mentioned before. It happened
thus: Just before knocking-off for dinner, I had given up the wash-dirt
to the man at the windlass, and put a prop in. On resuming work after
dinner, I remarked that the prop had got "as firm as a church," and
that I did not like the appearance of things at all, as this was a sign
that the ground was giving. I also said that, as the stuff would hardly
pay for driving much further, I would sweep it out and try in another
direction from the shaft which my brother had pointed out, where he had
got a fair prospect. I had just sent up the few buckets of sweepings,
and was pointing out to the windlass-man the direction I intended
driving, when, all of a sudden, without the least warning, the sides
of the shaft commenced cracking; large masses also from the lower part
breaking off. Of course, the rope was immediately let down, and I was
hauled up, but not before a large block of earth struck me on the knee,
which lamed me for about a week. Well, in about an hour afterwards,
the whole of the ground, for about half an acre, sunk bodily down. The
ground was completely honeycombed with drives. I was thankful I put
that prop in before dinner, as it gave the indication of danger.</p>

<p>As the mines are not now very interesting or attractive to intended
emigrants, it is not necessary to enlarge further. It will be
sufficient to say that when we broke up our partnership, my wife's
brothers, being single men, had saved, I think, about £400 each, but
I only had my share of the water right, which we also sold. My share
was about £60. The whole of my earnings, therefore, had gone to bring
up my large family. My money was invested in them, to be drawn upon
some day, by God's blessing, with interest&mdash;and compound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> interest,
too. Neighbors used to think they could command and use my boys as they
liked. "No," I said, "you cannot draw upon my bank in this way; you
must remunerate them for their services."</p>

<p>About this time, the Government were beginning to sell the country
lands in the district. My brothers went with their savings and
purchased land some thirty miles from the diggings, and started
farming&mdash;an occupation they had been used to in the "Old Country." I
continued working on the diggings with the boys for some time longer,
sinking and driving for "a patch" I thought should exist from the
formation and dip of the ground&mdash;but failed. A short time after,
though, a party went down one of my shafts, and only drove a few feet
and struck what I had been looking for so long. I believe it was about
£90 worth. This is a very common fate on the diggings. The largest
nugget ever got in Australia was found in an old drive only two or
three inches under the bottom. The original occupiers had actually
driven over and knelt over it, but the mass of gold, being so heavy,
had sunk into the pipe-clay, below the ordinary run of wash-dirt. I
could tell of many curious incidents of the sort. After this I and the
boys worked a puddling machine; some of them were able to do a fine
day's work now. We only just made a living, though, and had to keep the
horse; feed, also, was very expensive. I can remember hay being worth
£50 per ton, and that only bush hay; of course, it was only then used
for the Government&mdash;for police and gold escort horses. By this time
(1865), these old diggings were nearly worn out.</p>

<p>About this time (1865) the Government passed a new Land Act, opening
the lands of the colony for free selection, and deferred payment at £1
per acre, payable in half-yearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> payments of one shilling per acre,
without interest; certain improvements to be effected in residence,
fencing, clearing, cultivation, etc., enforced. Of this liberal Land
Act I thought I would avail myself. I could select up to 320 acres;
but that was beyond my means. At the next sitting of the Land Board I
selected 128 acres&mdash;the most suitable to my capital. A river-side lot.
Of this, 30 acres were river flat, not suitable for cultivation, being
subject to floods; 35 acres only were fit for cultivation, the other
portion being inferior, crab-holey, grass land. I said above, this
was most suitable to my capital. Upon selecting, I had only just cash
sufficient to pay the first deposit, as the first half-year's rent,
viz., £6 8s. Little enough, it will be said, after 10 years' hard labor
in the colony. But, remember, labor is equivalent to capital, and I was
backed with that banking account named before, viz., my seven good boys.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="Commencing_Farming" id="Commencing_Farming">Commencing Farming.</a></p>


<p>Now, striking out my digger's experience, I will dwell a little. It
may be asked, Why did I put upon the title page of this "Life Sketch,"
"How £6 8s. became £8000?" Why did I not start with the 10s. I landed
with? It is this. My object in writing at all is to induce others,
under similar circumstances and conditions, to settle upon the land;
therefore, I put down £6 8s., the amount I started farming with; or it
may be seen further on that I might have put down £76 8s., but, the
other £70 was only prospective, or hardly that at the time, as will be
seen. Well, even this is no great sum, as many a laborer can earn that,
or rather, can save that sum, in a little more than a year, at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
wages; pick and shovel men getting 7s. to 8s. per day. Had I a large
sum of money saved from mining, it might have been said&mdash;"Oh! with that
amount of capital, anyone ought to succeed."</p>

<p>So myself and two eldest sons started to make a home on the land.
At this time I had one son, the third, aged about 16, living upon a
station with squatters, not far from where we selected. He was getting
small wages, but at the same time he was getting good experience with
cattle, &amp;c., and his masters were gentlemen of high character, and for
whom I have the greatest respect. The two who joined me were now able
to do a good hard day's work, and they had to do it, too. So we started
at once. I left the wife and the smallest of the children (seven of
them, one other son being at a dairy some few miles off) for a time, at
the home on the diggings, and registered our claim for a few months to
prevent anyone "jumping" it.</p>

<p>We put up residence No. 1 on the farm, composed of two side logs, and
sheets of bark for top. We got a party to plough about an acre ready
for potatoes and vegetables, and then started into the bush, about six
miles off, to split fencing stuff; living under a few sheets of bark,
for about two months. While there, I wrote a letter to my good mother
in dear old England, and just in fun, headed it, "Splitters' Hall."
This was taken in earnest, and I received a letter in due course,
addressed to "Splitters' Hall." This gave us much amusement. Having got
our stuff split, a difficulty arose. How to get it out of the bush! We
must either give our labor to some farmer for a time for fetching it
out for us, or return to the claim, and try for a few pounds, as we
only had one old horse we used in the puddling machine, and no dray. We
determined, therefore, to go and wash a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> machines of stuff on the
claim. I took one of the boys with me, and, to our agreeable surprise
and astonishment, we washed out £70 worth of gold (alluded to before
at page 18) in one week. The only "patch" we ever got, and for which
I trust we were thankful enough; and grand indeed did it look as we
washed it off, and it followed the sluicing fork in the clean water in
washing down the boxes. But it was only just a "patch," and ran out the
next day. We call it our "Providential patch." On coming from the bank,
where I sold it, my pocket felt nicer than I ever recollected (except
upon one other occasion), and we all felt quite jubilant!</p>

<p>This other occasion I will insert here, although it should have been
in the sketch of my "Artist Experience." This is an occasion which I
shall always remember with pleasure and gratitude to the individual
who interested himself so kindly in my interest. I went into Norfolk
professionally, portrait painting, drawn on this occasion in that
direction by the attractions of a certain individual whose acquaintance
I had formed in London. The Bishop of London, who was always my friend,
and always kindly gave me letters of introduction, gave me one to the
Bishop of Norwich (Bishop Stanley), the father of the late honoured
Dean Stanley, of Westminster. He kindly introduced me to the Mayor
of Norwich, Mr. Freeman, as the best way to introduce my profession.
The first portrait I painted there was the Mayor's, in his robes of
office. He also kindly took charge of some paintings of fancy subjects
I took with me, to show to his friends. After painting for some time
in various parts of the country, in the meantime I got married, and
this act, I suppose, under the circumstances, would be considered (and
what is generally called) "improvident" and "imprudent," as I had no
settled home of my own. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> then became imperative that I got one. My
wife's home was about 22 miles from Norwich, and, as I always was a
great pedestrian, which I have mentioned before, I started off one fine
morning early to Norwich, to see my good friend, the Mayor, and inform
him of my position, and see what could be done with the paintings he
had charge of. We were dining together when I broached the subject. He
said my pictures had been much admired, and he thought several of his
fellow citizens would like to purchase them. He at once then, at the
table, wrote a note stating my intention of leaving for London, and
would they make me an offer for one or more of my pictures. An answer
was soon back, but the answer and offer was not satisfactory to him.
"No," he said, "he shan't have it for that;" sent a note to another,
and thus this novel auction went on until he got rid of several of my
pictures, and, as the term is, "at satisfactory prices," and before
the evening I had the money in my pocket (between £66 and £70), and,
indeed, it felt warm, as my heart also did, with gratitude. On starting
back <i>the same evening</i>, how I "lift my feet!" Like Jacob of old, after
his dream and receiving the blessing. (Read from Gen. 10th v. xxviii
ch. to 1st v. xxix ch.). It says&mdash;"<i>He went on his journey</i>;" but the
Heb. in the margin is far more expressive to one who has gone through
a somewhat similar experience. It there says&mdash;"<i>He lift up his feet</i>."
Light of heart, light of heel. I well remember the son of the Mayor, a
fine young fellow, about my own age, accompanying me for a few miles
on my journey back, conversing by the way (as christians love to do)
of God's good providence and love; and who knows but what there was
a third person in <i>spirit</i> with us, as He was in <i>person</i> with the
"two disciples on the road that evening journeying to Emmaus?" But
it could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> be said of us that "we were sad," as they were. They
were sad because the "Comforter" had not then come, but we were in
full enjoyment of that "Comforter." And they, also, when the Saviour
revealed Himself, had "burning hearts of love;" and did not our hearts
burn with love also? On our parting, with a good-bye and a hearty
and friendly grip, I shall never forget his kindly words. They were
these&mdash;"<i>Remember how sweet is the day of prosperity to those who have
tasted adversity's cup</i>." And thus we parted on that memorable day and
evening on the Norwich high road.</p>

<p>I hardly felt the remainder of my long walk. It was rather late in the
evening (or rather night) when I reached home, and, upon entering,
threw the proceeds of my trip into my young wife's lap. Our feelings
may be imagined.</p>

<p>We then went up to London and furnished our first home at Clapham, as
narrated in the sketch of "My Artist's Life." It will be seen that this
transpired before my health broke down from over study.</p>

<p>But to resume. With this £70 from the claim we purchased a good draught
horse, new dray, etc., so that we were enabled to cart our fencing
stuff, and felt quite like getting on. After erecting the fence around
a good part of the allotment, we commenced clearing the land, as there
was a good bit of timber on. Grubbing trees, chopping up, and burning
off, occupied us during the winter. We found hut No. 1 rather cold some
nights, as our fire was outside. I often took my blankets and slept
outside by the large fires, where the large logs were being burned off;
these, also, required "rounding up" during the night. We got about 12
acres cleared, ploughed, and sown with wheat and oats by the month
of June. We started then with the orchard and garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> planted about
50 fruit trees of various sorts, and put in a few vines. This should
always be done as soon as possible, but very few do it. We considered
now we had got fairly started. Thus: A good deal of the fencing done,
12 acres cleared and under crop, orchard and garden dug and planted,
one good horse and dray, also old puddling horse, being light, was
useful for riding, etc.; three cows, with calves, from the station; out
of my son's wages&mdash;2 pigs in the sty, and a few dozen fowls. Therefore
we began thinking of shifting the family down. I sold our claim for a
few pounds, and as our house on the diggings was still good, we shifted
the materials down, and erected farm residence No. 2. This put us up
till nearly our first harvest time. Thus we were all together again,
except the son at the station, but he was only a few miles off. Our
youngest child at this time&mdash;a boy&mdash;was 2 years old. We did not leave
the digging's home, though, without some regrets. God having blessed
us with many peaceful years of comfort and independence, and, although
we had not saved much money, it did not interfere with our happiness;
and the hills were very healthy, abounding in crystal springs, as will
be supposed, for during the 10 years' residence I had no occasion to
consult a medical man. It was a great blessing with 11 young children.
I had, however, made it a duty to study medicine to some extent,
which is necessary in a colony like this, and, particularly in those
early days. Up to this time all our furniture had been home-made bush
furniture, with the exception of one sofa-bedstead, and one American
rocking chair, but then it matched with the bush residences. I now made
a new set of furniture for our farm-house.</p>

<p>I have now to record a great sorrow which befell us. We had not all
been together on the farm many weeks, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> lost our fifth son,
by drowning. He was a fine lad of 15 years. It happened in this way.
He was out with the gun, keeping the cockatoos off the crops, but
seeing some ducks in a lagoon near the river, he shot one of them, and
stripped and swam in to secure it. He was a fine swimmer. He, however,
did not, in his hurry, take the precaution to keep his cap on, as
he always did when bathing, and, it being an exceedingly hot day, I
believe he got sunstruck, as his younger brother, who was with him,
said he laid upon the top of the water some time. There were several
parties sunstruck on that day. He was a good boy, and had that morning,
as usual, with his brothers and sisters, said their prayers, and sang
together their little hymn&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Why will you doubting stand?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>There is one there awaiting us "beyond the river."</p>

<p>Myself and boys kept grubbing and clearing, and got in four acres of
maize by harvest time. Two of them then went to assist their uncles at
harvest; they resided about six miles from us. They coming, in return,
to help us. So our first harvest-home in Victoria was completed. "The
wilderness was, indeed, blossoming as the rose," and we felt proud
at being permitted to fulfil the Heavenly behest of "subduing and
replenishing the earth." What occupation on earth can equal that of
the husbandman, to raise man's mind from "Nature to Nature's God";
that is, to a properly-regulated mind. To see the beautiful order of
all Creation. The unerring instinct of animals. The song and wonderful
plumage of birds, so very beautiful in Australia. The sweet hum of the
busy bee fructifying the beautiful flowers, and modelling their cells
so wonderfully and as unerringly as in the garden of Eden. Man, in his
regenerate state, standing thus amid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> these surroundings, and leaning
upon the merits of his Saviour alone, to atone for the sin of the first
Adam, and with his face and aspirations raised heavenward, must feel
that Paradise is, in a measure, restored even in this world. He has, at
least, a foretaste of the Paradise above.</p>

<p>Unregenerate man alone appears the only contradictory element and
anomaly in the universe.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="Increasing_our_Holdings" id="Increasing_our_Holdings">Increasing our Holdings.</a></p>


<p>We selected 115 acres more land the next year, and 95 the year after.
All spare time, the two eldest sons went out fencing, etc., for other
settlers, but, in a few years, we had plenty of work at home, and
our son from the station joined us; the other sons, as well, growing
up strong and useful. My wife and daughters also busy attending to
housework, dairying, etc., which now had increased considerably by
natural increase and further purchases. Horse stock also increased in
the same way. Thus we have gone on year after year, all working for one
common object and mutual welfare, and which we have now continued to do
for nearly 25 years on the farm up to this time, 1891. Two of my sons
have selected other allotments, and we have purchased two "drunk out"
farms from the mortgagees. We also, in 1884, purchased a very eligible
block of land. We had to pay dearly for it, though. It contained about
400 acres of good tillage land&mdash;good for this district, where land is
not first-class, like many parts of Victoria. For this, we gave £8 per
acre, and for 636 acres of grass land adjoining, £4 per acre, costing
altogether over £6000. This we had to get partly upon loan. With our
own great strength, now of six grown-up sons, and plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> of horse
strength besides, we have reaped in produce and stock from the same
land, quite two-thirds of the amount, and expect in a few more years'
crops to clear it, so that it was a good investment, but there has been
very heavy labor attached to it.</p>

<p>Although we have a large quantity of the finest land in the district
suitable for Hop-growing, we have scrupulously and conscientiously
refrained from growing the same; considering it would be most
inconsistent with our principles to have anything whatever, directly or
indirectly, to do with any product that contributed to the production
of that substance that has been the greatest curse to the world; also
putting some of the best land to a base use, instead of using it for
the benefit of mankind. The Hop is different altogether from the Grape,
or Barley, as they are in themselves a blessing, and of eminent use to
man, properly and rationally used.</p>

<p>About six years since we erected on the "Home Farm"&mdash;our first
selection&mdash;Residence No. 3, a superior brick house, which cost about
£500, and very desirable now and appreciated, as wife and I are growing
old&mdash;self, 74; wife, a few years younger. The bush furniture has given
place to as good a suite of furniture as anyone could wish for in
sitting, bedrooms, etc., also a superior organ, with which to praise
and glorify the good God who has blessed and prospered us. I have,
besides, taken the brush in hand again to adorn the walls, and leave
some of my handiwork behind me for the children. In fact, for the last
eight years I have done a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> paintings, sold a few landscapes, and
exhibited them at various places in the colonies; also sent a large
one to the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London, for which I got a
certificate and medal. Heavy, laborious work, of course, begins to tell
upon me now if long continued, so that this "soft-handed" work is a
relaxation. My department now in the firm is principally in the garden
and orchard, of which we have now a large one, both fancy and useful.
We have also an orangery recently planted, have also a good many old
trees, which bear wonderfully well. We irrigate with a horse-pump.</p>

<p>We are all still working together in partnership, as it has always been
my policy to give my sons a direct interest in all our undertakings and
property, and this is only right and just, as to them mainly, under
God's blessing, I must attribute our success; anyhow, the labor portion
has largely devolved upon them.</p>

<p>We stand now (1891), after 25 years on the farms, thus:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="land" width="35%">
<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">Amount of Land, 2,523 acres</td>

<tr><td>At a fair valuation, free</td>
 <td align="right">£6,150</td></tr>

<td colspan="2" align="right">£8,200</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Thus I have shown, as I promised, how £6 8s., or, if you like, £76 8s.,
has increased to £8,000.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, although this looks a nice sum of money, that if
divided between six sons and four daughters, the amount for each would
not be large; say among the six sons, the amount to each would only
be about £1,350. However, by still holding together in partnership,
they can increase it much more than if they divided; in fact, they are
just doing so by purchasing a property in New South Wales of 3,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
acres, mainly for sheep-farming. Besides, I have known steady, single
farm-men, as hired hands at £1 per week and "found," and £1 10s. per
week for harvest work, who have banked at least £40 per year, for over
20 years, which, with compound interest, I presume would total up to
the above sum. Not that I am an advocate for this style of saving, as,
when the money was about half that sum, they would have the means to
marry and settle down; thus be better citizens, and add more to the
prosperity of the colony.</p>

<p>Now, doubtless, the question will be asked by many situated as I was,
and others, "Can I do the same?" My answer is, I really cannot see why
they cannot. But they must have seen that even upon the land, there is
a very rough time to go through, especially in new country, and many
years of careful labor, though, with all, a pleasant, healthful, and
independent occupation, and, "with a long pull, and a strong pull, and
a pull altogether," and a firm reliance on God's blessing, a peaceful
and restful end.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="A_Dissertation_on_Temperance" id="A_Dissertation_on_Temperance">A Dissertation on Temperance.</a></p>


<p>It must be born in mind, however, that there was one great and
important, if not indispensable factor, which I have not mentioned
in the foregoing sketch, that has greatly contributed to our
success, viz.:&mdash;The curse of alcohol was never permitted to enter
or pollute our home. I was early in life (1840) convinced of the
advantages, physically and morally, of abstaining from the narcotic
poison&mdash;alcohol. My pledge card, which I still have and keep with
much pride, is dated 1841. I had abstained some time before, so that
I can count over half a century in this good cause. And I am happy
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> say the whole of my children have followed our example, and it
was only natural that they should do so, as I am a firm believer in
parental example. When this great cause was first advocated, we all
gladly joined it, as we, as a family, had suffered from the curse&mdash;and
what family has not, in some measure? My own father was a victim to
the demon; but those were days of ignorance, and drunkenness was only
looked upon as a venial weakness, and almost as a virtue among all
classes&mdash;the clergy not even exempt; and it was considered a breach
of hospitality if you did not make your guests drunk. Thank God those
bad old times are past! My dear parent was more excused as he was a
naval man&mdash;a "man-of-war's-man," and fought under the great Nelson, and
at that time it was thought necessary to make men half mad with rum
before they could fight. Now: how changed! The commanders call for the
teetotalers when they want any particular or dangerous duty performed.
I said, as a family we suffered, for he died early in life, and left
his widow with six very young children to battle alone in the world.
But I must draw the curtain; we cannot claim ignorance now.</p>

<p>Now, do not let it be understood that I mean to say that no one will
succeed unless they are abstainers; but from my long experience and
extensive observation, it is extremely rare to find those who started
with moderation in intoxicants, can continue so, at least with the
potations in the same quantity or strength; it is almost physically
impossible to do so. Alcohol is a substance that principally exerts
its influence on the nervous system, like opium&mdash;a kindred substance.
It creates an artificial appetite or craving, and nervous prostration
is the result, which can only be relieved, in thousands of cases, by
a continued increase in quantity or strength, and a diseased state of
the system is insensibly created. In very many cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> moderation is
impossible. No man ever started in life with the intention of being a
drunkard, and if you suggested the possibility of such, he would be
most indignant. Nevertheless, they fall against their will. Neither
do I think any man leaves his home and family with the deliberate
intention of getting drunk, and coming home to abuse those who, in his
sober moments, he treats with affection. If he did so, such a man has
fallen far below the brute creation. Man is simply deluding himself
with this alluring and fascinating "serpent." In fact, "mocked," and
"he that is deceived thereby is not wise." And the true wisdom is to
banish this "curse of the race" from your home, as no one knows how
soon they or someone dear to them, may be drawn into this snare. I
never knew an abstainer but what prospered in this colony, and I have
known hundreds of drinkers "go to the wall." I have not known a single
farmer in this district who planted a vineyard, and made wine, who
has not been "bitten by his own dog," and died prematurely; except
one, and he sold out, but is still a confirmed drunkard. Alas! what
shocking tales I could tell of wasted homes. I have already mentioned
two "drunk out" farms we purchased&mdash;premature deaths, violent deaths.
Children turned adrift on the world, sacred and loving ties sundered,
etc., etc., simply from indulgence in this most insidious, useless,
and dangerous habit. However, a brighter day is dawning even for
Australia, which, as yet, is far behind in this glorious movement
of true temperance (temperance in all lawful things). Alcohol is
unlawful, being foreign and destructive to man's physical nature, but
the total abstinence cause is destined also to be the moral salvation
of the world, and the hand-maid and stepping-stone to a religious and
Christian life. And I am happy to say many of our youth are seeing the
advantages and duty of abstinence from intoxicants.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many of our politicians and others are advocating
the advantages of the vine-growing industry for making wine, and have
even dubbed Australia&mdash;"John Bull's Vineyard." Yes, vineyard, I will,
if you like, endorse, but "Wine Shop," which they mean, I will ignore.
The grape, rightly used, is one of God's greatest gifts, and I would
like to see every hill-top clothed with the vine, but not quite so, for
we are, or should be, wise enough to know that the hill-tops should
never be denuded of their forest's adornment. Say every hill-side. The
pure "fruit of the vine," the blood of the grape unfermented, or grapes
preserved as raisins, are wonderfully nutritious, and contain many
of the elements of the blood. By fermentation, which is a process of
decay and destruction, nearly the whole of the nutriment is destroyed.
Thus, the gluten and gum are entirely destroyed. Six-sevenths of the
albumen, and four-fifths of the sugar, and most of the others, are also
destroyed. And what do we get <i>in lieu</i>. Why, a narcotic, sleeping,
irritant (irritating) poison; irritating, though, should have been
placed first, as it excites the passions to commit every evil deed,
long before the drunken or sleepy stage commences. Now, will any
sane person have the temerity to say that this poison alcohol, the
substance created by the destruction of all these life-sustaining
constituents, is "the good gift of God" as "received from His hand?"
There is hardly a substance on earth but what can be and has, in like
manner, been perverted. Grain of all sorts, fruit, rice, potatoes,
beet-root, starchy substances of all sorts, in fact, anything that
can be converted into saccharine (sugar: the foundation of alcohol),
milk also, and even meat. Were all these good gifts ever intended to
be worse than destroyed?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> In the United Kingdom, 80,000,000 bushels of
bread food are thus destroyed, when millions of people are in a state
of pauperism or semi-starvation. And all this waste, to do what? To
feed men? No. To give health? No. Strength? No. To warm? No. To allay
this? No. It is of no earthly use whatever. But this it does. Debases
men below the beast, also producing crime, poverty, disease, and moral
degradation. This is the sum total that man reaps for destroying the
bountiful fruits of the Creator.</p>

<p>Is it then a wise policy on the part of a paternal Government to unduly
encourage the manufacture of wine in bonuses and viticultural colleges?
Is it patriotic? Is it philanthropic? Is it <span class="smcap">Christian</span>! With
a climate that can produce wine by natural fermentation up to 34 per
cent. (this is disputed by experts in Europe) of alcoholic strength,
two-thirds the strength of brandy, and a very large quantity is being
distilled into brandy, how can we expect a sober people?</p>

<p>It may appear to some that I have dwelt unreasonably long upon this
question, but feeling strongly, I must write strongly.</p>

<p>Having, therefore, pointed out to the best of my ability what I
consider the greatest drawback to the advancement of this fair colony,
viz., the wasteful expenditure of 6,000,000 of money annually for
Victoria alone, I will return to consider at greater length the object
for which this sketch was mainly written.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="The_Settlement_of_the_Lands" id="The_Settlement_of_the_Lands">The Settlement of the Lands.</a></p>


<p>Husbandry is the source of all true wealth, and the back-bone of
every country. I regret to say the farming interest in Victoria has
been heavily handicapped by the protective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> duties, to sustain the
interests of the manufacturers and importers. The crisis came upon the
farmers first, as soon as they had to compete in the world's market,
and it will come upon the manufacturers just in the same way, when
they have over-produced for the home market. It is just now upon the
turning point. Can they compete with the world with men's present
wages, and eight hours' labor? I very much doubt it. If not, what will
they do with their surplus goods. Farmers' sons have had to rush the
cities for employment, and there is a vast population just growing
into manhood&mdash;sons of artisans, which our football matches testify.
Can these be absorbed into the various trades? I don't like taking a
gloomy view of things, but I think the subject should have very serious
thought. It is very easy to boast about the eight hours' movement, and
wages to be fixed, and "strikes" ordered by a Trades' Hall Council.
But will they provide an outlet for the working man's commodities at
colonial prices? But to return to the land. In the first place, I may
say as regards Victoria, the open selection of Crown land has ceased.
Even the grazing blocks, under the new Act, 1884, which nearly covers
all the inferior or waste land, I think are all pretty well taken up,
and the only hope now is the breaking up or sub-division of the large
estates, and they comprise, luckily, the very finest runs of land, on
100 acres of which, a family could live better than on 320 of ordinary
land. Of course, to get this good land requires some capital, but the
return lies surely in the soil, and it only requires labor&mdash;the poor
man's capital&mdash;with strict economy, to recover the first expenditure.
The breaking up of these large estates will be the making of Victoria.
Or the cutting up into tenant blocks would be even better for the
owners, and better for men of limited means. A ten years' lease on
prime land should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> make him independent. I don't mean make his fortune,
but should place him in a position to go ahead. This is the only land
that will bear a dense population, or bear intense cultivation, and
is, in fact, the only hope for the colony. This want of land for the
rising generation is the cause of so many of our young men&mdash;farmers'
sons&mdash;seeking employment in Melbourne, their parents' holdings not
being sufficient to maintain the whole of the family, and many are
marrying, and desire to have homes of their own. I trust the large
owners of estates are patriotic, if not philanthropic enough to see
the necessity of this, which is also a duty to God and man, for it
is pitiable to see men willing to go upon the land, and many with
sufficient means, looking about in vain. Without these are cultivated,
how can the population increase as it should? And how can work be found
for the artisans in the cities? These and the farmers must go hand in
hand, and prosper together; for if the 130,000 farmers have only a
surplus of an average of £10 each yearly, it throws into their hands
£1,300,000&mdash;no insignificant sum. To a small extent, there has been a
disposition to sub-divide. I trust they will increase a hundred-fold.</p>

<p>I think it will be seen from what I have written, that for "New Chums,"
at least in Victoria, there is not much chance for settling on the
land, without they possess a few hundreds in cash. Therefore they
must be satisfied with patient, frugal labor for a few years, to save
sufficient capital. But there are the other colonies of Australia&mdash;New
South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, and Western Australia, where
they have liberal land laws. Splendid countries, inviting capital and
labor, and upon which, in the various latitudes, the products of the
whole world can be grown to the greatest perfection, and the area
so vast, that the population of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> Europe could be set down;
but a very great portion of it, from its position, climate, etc., is
not very inviting, or hardly suitable for needy emigrants. There is,
though, a vast outlet for the profitable investment of capital in those
outlying districts. Capital and labor must go hand in hand like twin
brothers. Then the waste places of the earth would soon "blossom as
the rose," and we should soon find the over-stocked hives of the old
lands relieved of the burden of humanity, for as yet it is idle to
talk of the "over-population of the world;" why, we know in fact that
as yet it is not half populated, not only Australia. Look at the vast
country of South America, watered by that mighty river the Amazon, also
the Argentine Republic. Then the great north-west of Canada, also the
regions of the Congo and Central Africa, and many other considerable
and desirable places. Yes, there is room enough yet in the ample and
bountiful bosom of "Mother Earth," and she is inviting, with open arms,
her children to partake of her bounties. We hear a great deal about
"over-population" and "over-production." Why is it? Simply because the
great masses of the working bees are not placed in a position to gather
the world's honey, and thus to become customers for the products of
the manufacturing countries. <i>The cry should be&mdash;Put the people on the
lands, at whatever cost!</i> They will return interest an hundred-fold.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="Irrigation" id="Irrigation">Irrigation.</a></p>


<p>At the present time the subject of irrigation is absorbing the
attention of the Government and the community in general. The
appointment of the Royal Commission on Water Supply was a grand idea,
and for which the colony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> should be grateful, and particularly to the
president, the Honourable Alfred Deakin, M.P., for his arduous and
indefatigable labor to promote a general interest in the subject. The
visit also of the Commission to America, and the report of the same,
are highly interesting and useful, and which led to the establishment
of Messrs Chaffey Bros.' Irrigation Colony at Mildura. This will do
immense good. It will be an open book, giving ocular and practical
demonstration of the advantages of water and intense cultivation, but
above all, to show how capital can be advantageously invested for
the mutual and common good, and I think it will lead to many such in
Victoria, and also extend right across the continent to the Gulf of
Carpentaria, and thus make a profitable outlet for English capital, and
at the same time relieve the old lands of the plethora of humanity.
What can be done in arid countries without water? What would India,
Egypt, Italy, &amp;c., be without irrigation? In fact, it is the life of
all nature. We can hardly estimate its value. It is the only solvent
and menstruum to set free the constituents of the soil. Intense culture
with water requires intense labor and intense manuring. It will also
require cheap labor and cheap mechanical appliances. At present our
machinery is nearly double the price it is in America. How then can we
compete with the world without we start fairly? A 50-acre irrigated
farm will suffice to keep a family comfortably, as crops are not only
doubled, but you can double crop. That is, take at least two crops,
one grain and the other roots or fodder plants, in one season, and you
can cut fodder crops three or four times, and lucerne five or six. I
have experimented for some years, and I have come to the conclusion
that "soakage" is the best; that is, run the water in the furrows
between the lands or beds, not too wide, so that the water, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
capillary attraction, may soak quite through. There is a very great
deal to learn. The right time to put the water on, and the time to
leave off, otherwise it will do more harm than good. For fruit, also,
you must not keep watering too long, or the fruit will never mature
properly, and be of inferior flavor and quality, and the young wood
will not mature for the next year's crop. Independent of fruit growing,
which is so much advocated just now, I think irrigation is of as much
advantage to the general farmer, not so much for corn growing, as it
is difficult to catch the right time, and an excess is pretty sure to
create mildew and rust; but for roots and fodder crops, and "catching
crops" after harvests, for the dairy, etc., too much cannot be said in
favor of irrigation. Every stream, however small, running through a
dry country, should be utilised, if not, it is so much wealth running
to waste, and its use to the dairy industry, which has advanced with
such strides during the last few years, is not half enough appreciated.
The Government has aided this industry most liberally, and it has been
the making of thousands of families, but improved methods of growing
crops by irrigation and better feeding, and an improved breed of dairy
cattle, would quite double the produce. I think I have said enough as
to the advantages and difficulties of irrigation, difficulties which
experience will overcome.</p>

<p>As this "Life's Sketch" was written mainly to induce the settlement of
the people on the land, my concluding division will be an endeavour to

<p>It appears strange that the wealth of Great Britain has not gone in
this direction long ago for the benefit of her own sons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> "Charity
should begin at home." The poverty and the drudgery of the masses
is appalling in England, and this by the side of enormous wealth. A
burden of poverty and a burden of wealth. Strange anomaly! Not only
the produce market, but the money market as well, is regulated by
Great Britain. The hands and eyes of the whole world are lifted up to
her! What would be the state of most countries without the markets and
wealth of England? Look at the millions wasted in worthless Turkey.
Then we see the millions that have been spent in India and Egypt.
Blessing indeed, no doubt, to those countries. Then it appears so
passing strange that a portion of this British wealth has not been
diverted more to the lands of her colonies <i>in a systematic way</i>, and
there can be no safer investment. N.B.&mdash;The Chaffey Brothers' scheme.</p>

<p>We find, however, that the British Government are commencing action in
this direction, at least at home, in establishing peasant proprietary,
and millions of money is to be appropriated to this purpose in
purchasing land, &amp;c. This is a step in the right direction, and I
trust this sort of thing will be extended to the colonies, where, as I
said before, there is room for another Europe. Britain's sons and our
colonies should be thought of first. It would not be charity. Charity
in this sense is rather an unchristian term; the benefits would be
reciprocal. When her sons are wanted for the defence of the Empire,
they are willing to lay down their lives by thousands, and millions
upon millions of money, for the purpose of war, is forthcoming. Is it,
then, too much to ask that a few millions be spent in the cause of
peace, to enable them to do battle with rugged nature?</p>

<p>As regards the extension of settlements in Victoria, I think I have
hinted enough respecting the necessity of sub-division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> and irrigation.
I think after a few years, when the advantages of irrigation have
been proved, many will be glad to sub-divide their present holdings
of 320 acres, and confine themselves to half the quantity, especially
if the anticipations of the fruit industry are realised, and I have
considerable faith in them, but not such glowing results as are held
out; only one-half of the profits stated would suffice. One thing we
know: this generation appears to have made the discovery that man is
more of a fruit and vegetable eater than was before supposed, so that
therein a good deal of our hope lies. By the partaking of fruit, we
require much less drink, as a pound of most fruits contain more than
three-quarters of a pound of water; we may say three-quarters of a pint
to one pound, so that they are eminently meat and drink. As to the
other vast portions of Australia, I can see no hope for settlement,
particularly in the arid districts, without either the Governments
at home or in the colonies, or syndicates, take the matter up. With
respect to individual settlements in these parts, we cannot compare it
with North America; the conditions are so very different, there is such
a very small portion of Australia in the temperate zone, the climate
of which is so suitable for European constitutions, whereas, in North
America and Canada, there is an enormous territory congenial for the
products and people of temperate climates. In Australia, wheat appears
to fail north of 30deg., at least, it does not pay to grow it without
it is on table-land, such as part of New England district in New
South Wales. It is strange that as yet that great colony, four times
as large as Victoria, does not grow near corn enough to feed her own
people, and Victoria has already exported this year, 1891, millions of
bushels. Well, as regards that, Victoria cannot boast, and it is quite
as strange that they cannot, or do not grow half meat enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> for the
insignificant population. The facilities and inducements for settlement
in America are grand. Many a sturdy man has "gone west" into the wild
woods, and made a home with nothing more than his axe, and a bag of
seeds, living well in the meantime upon the indigenous products of that
splendid country, which are abundant. Wild animals, large and small,
birds, fish, native fruits and nuts, and sugar from the maple tree, &amp;c.
Truly, that was a rich land! But nothing of this sort can be attempted
in Australia.</p>

<p>If I were to draw up a plan of settlement, basing the costs according
to my own personal experience, but depending upon a company for the
capital to start with, I would advise, after the company had agreed
with the Government for the purchase of the land, and the same was
surveyed in blocks of 200 acres each, to settle down 200 families,
which would amount to 40,000 acres, and a reserved right for 40,000
more at a somewhat higher figure. The cost to place each family of
say five individuals, would be about £200 each family; that is, to
pay passage, supply them with food, implements, stock, seeds, &amp;c.,
for the first year, until some produce came to hand. Residences, of
course, would be rough, and should be erected by themselves. Thus
far the support and provision of the 200 families for one year would
be £40,000, or for 1600 families&mdash;8000 souls&mdash;£500,000. Say, for
illustration, the company got the land for two shillings per acre,
and gave each family a lease for 10 years at two shillings an acre
per annum, the payment to be for purchase money, so that at the end
of 10 years it would be his own, having paid the company £1 per acre.
The £200 also, advanced in the first instance, to be paid off by
instalments with 6 per cent. interest per annum added, so that at the
end of ten years or a little more, each family should be possessed
of their own freehold, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> considerable increase of stock, etc.
The company should have a depôt, where everything necessary for the
settlement could be supplied at the lowest possible rate, and also
undertake to preserve and market the produce of the settlers to the
best advantage, to ensure them the highest possible price, like Chaffey
Bros. propose doing. To go more into detail and figures as to the first
year's expenses of a family of five, I would put it down thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>If a family of five&mdash;husband, wife, one daughter, and two strong lads
of from 14 to 16 years of age&mdash;entered upon the land in the month of
January, and started at once putting up a house and getting stuff
ready, they should be able to do all the work among themselves, and
get the wheat and oats in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> in June&mdash;orchard and garden in July. The
maize ground could be left until the fence was up round the crop. The
amounts put down for food may look small, but it would not be more than
that, as in six months (and before, with milk, butter and eggs) they
would have potatoes, &amp;c., from the garden, and one pig killed, which
together would be half a living. Such a scheme as this could be easily
worked out in detail, and thus I think millions of capital could be
profitably invested. In fact, without some such scheme I don't know how
the vast territories under the British Crown, now lying waste, can be
utilised. A few such settlements would give an immense impetus to trade
and manufacture, and we should soon cease to hear the cries of "want
of employment," "over-population," and "over-production." N.B.&mdash;Such
a scheme should commend itself to General Booth. It may further be
said as regards settling a large population upon the land with intense
culture&mdash;What is the amount of land a family can comfortably live
upon? The sub-division of land has taken place considerably in the
original eastern States of America. I see by the Government reports
of the State of Massachusetts, 71,000 persons live from the products
of farms averaging only 56 acres, and the average size of farms over
the whole State in 1850 was 99 acres; in 1875, 76 acres, so that they
are now being reduced. The income of these farmers average about
£125 per year, independent, I presume, of farm products consumed by
themselves. Any way, it shows a very thrifty, frugal, and industrious
people. The population also has increased in the 13 original States
from 15 per square mile in 1780, including towns, to 55 in 1880, <i>or
over 11 individuals to the acre</i>. This is amazing! Then take Belgium,
France, and Ireland, where families live, or appear to do so, or are
compelled to do so, comfortably upon only five, eight, and ten acres of
land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> Take France, as its position, various industries, and climate
much resemble Victoria. I find by the Government reports that there is
a population of nineteen millions (19,000,000) existing on farms of
about eight acres each. This is wonderful! And, as our Governments are
partial to commissions, it would be very interesting and instructive
if we had one to go through France, as they did through California, to
see how these farmers manage their system of farming, various products,
prices, &amp;c., also diet, beverages and social standing. It would, I
think, open the eyes of some of the settlers in Victoria who say they
cannot make a living on 320 acres. I can give a very good example of
frugality, and also details of a farm in Ireland under Earl Spencer's
prize system, on his estates. A tenant named Hill was awarded the first
prize; area, 11 acres.</p>

<p>I (the reporter) asked Hill what wages weekly would have been equal
to this. He seemed astonished at such a question, and confessed that
no reasonable wages could have placed him in such a comfortable and
independent position.</p>

<p>This is a modest affair, and yet the tenant was most contented and
happy.</p>

<p>In concluding this section, I must say I would very much like to see
in Victoria, a small model farm of say 25 acres of tillage as a dairy
farm; everything to be consumed on the farm; that is, all the produce
from the land&mdash;hay, straw, fodder plants, roots, etc.&mdash;and the whole to
be under the direction and supervision of the Minister of Agriculture,
and the Government Agricultural Chemist, &mdash;&mdash; Martin, Esq., and
everything carried out under an intelligent tenant and his family, and
a strict balance-sheet kept.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="A_Glimpse_at_the_Future_of_Australia" id="A_Glimpse_at_the_Future_of_Australia">A Glimpse at the Future of Australia.</a></p>


<p>I am not so sanguine as many that Australia, in the near future, will
have such a very large population, and particularly a European one.
There is not temperate climate enough. I have already stated that
wheat cannot be profitably grown beyond 30 degrees of latitude north,
and we may say most of the European products also, and the climate,
beyond another 20 degrees, is not suitable for European constitutions
to labor in. If we, therefore, draw a line at 30 degrees across the map
of Australia, we shall see the insignificant portion there is left in
the temperate zone; we shall find it not one-fourth of the continent.
Take it through Western Australia, and there is just a little corner.
What, then, is the future of the enormous country north of 30 degrees,
and which is only suitable for tropical and semi-tropical products, all
of which will grow to the greatest perfection? The question then is,
will Europeans grow these products? I think not. At least, not European
labor. It must, and no doubt will be done, by large companies, by
employing Chinese, Coolie, or Kanaka labor, under the superintendence
of Europeans. These hotter regions, otherwise, will never be utilized.
Therefore, it is my belief that instead of persecuting and expelling
these races as the fashion now is, we shall be glad to invite them
to assist in developing this vast territory. I think this conclusion
will strike everyone as correct, who calmly reflects upon the subject.
Besides, the products of these districts, such as sugar, rice, tea,
coffee, etc., require so much hand labor, that to compete with these
with other countries which have cheap labor, will be impossible. Even
at the present day, neither Englishmen nor Europeans will do the
necessary work in the northern districts, and even in Victoria our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
tobacco, hops, and vine industries can hardly be carried on without
the despised Chinese. We have an example already in the sugar industry
in Queensland. Recently a plant was up for sale that cost £26,000, and
the highest offer was £5000. What are we then to do without this cheap
labor? Without it this vast territory must evidently remain in a state
of nature, or still be devoted to wandering herds of cattle, and by
their vast numbers cripple the farmers of the more temperate parts by
competition. Where, then, are the boasted millions of population to
come from, which so many calculate upon?</p>

<p>One great factor which will stay the progress of this great country
more than any other is the present jealousy and war between Capital and
Labor. No country can advance without there is perfect security for
life and property. If capital cannot find security in one country, it
can easily go to another. Social order must be maintained at all costs.
It appears coming to this, whether the Elected Government is to rule
the country, or the Trades' Hall Council. There is a class of men in
Melbourne who want to fix things according to their own Utopian ideas,
and upon such "hard and fast" lines that would be totally unbearable
and tyrannical even to their own class. It would be well for them to
ponder the wise words recently uttered by President Harrison, viz.,
"<i>The safety of the State, the good order of the community, all that is
good, the capacity, indeed, to produce material wealth, is dependent
upon the intelligence and social order. Wealth and commerce are timid
creatures, they must be assured that the rest will be safe before they
build. So it is always in those communities where the most perfect
order is maintained, where intelligence is protected, where the Church
of God, and the institutions of religion are revered and respected,
we find the largest develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>ments of material wealth.</i>" There is far
too much "dog in the manger" feeling among the well-to-do artisans
in Melbourne. They are jealous of others coming into this good land.
They were glad enough to come themselves. It is the fear that a few
shillings will come off their own wages. It is strange that sensible
men, with any idea in their own heads, can listen to, or be guided by
the strange contradictory logic of the leaders of the labor party.
Recently, one of them said, speaking against the "Bloated Capitalists,"
"those who are living without working, you may depend upon it, are
living upon those who do work, and that all independent people are
'loafers or parasites' on the State." Holding that independence is
a crime. Well, many of their own class, by industry and frugality,
are independent or approaching to it. These, then, are graduating to
this new species of crime. Another said these "loafers and parasites"
should be compelled to turn out and work, and in the next breath called
competition the work of the devil, and over-production the curse of
the colony. According to this logic, if all were workers and all
producers&mdash;what then? The greatness of Melbourne consists of the great
number of independent non-workers, who employ and consume the produce
of the workers, and this is also the secret of England's greatness, and
their wealth is assisting the great national works of the whole world.
These wiseacres even dictate to the farmers in this matter, thinking,
I suppose, that they cannot see a yard from the plough-tail. If we get
an overplus, and the prices consequently lower, and of which they reap
the benefit, they tell us it is over-production again, and say, "Why
don't you just produce what the colony requires, and then you would be
all right?" But should we do so, and their loaf be double the price,
which it would be, they would be the first to cry out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> "we were
not utilising the land." Not considering that in advocating this grand
remedy, this colony, instead of exporting millions of bushels of wheat
to feed the hungry in Europe, would simply revert to a sheep walk, or
nearly so, and two-thirds of the agricultural population would swell
the present too over-crowded cities, and increase their own ranks with
double the number of workers&mdash;and what then? The railways also might
shut up, as sheep, &amp;c., can travel to market on their own legs. But
enough of this. The farming and the town interests are identical, the
one cannot prosper without the other, but the farmer can get over a
pinch best. Farming also is paramount, and Governments should see to
it as soon as possible and establish farm colonies&mdash;see that the large
estates are put to the best use. Previous Governments have frittered
away the best of the land by special surveys, and permitting dummyism.
<i>They should also see that the remaining unalienated land is kept in
the hands of the State, and only leased to tenants.</i> A 20 years' lease,
renewable, is almost as good as a freehold, and suits thousands better.
Large estates in England have been let in this way, and have remained
in the hands of the same tenants for generations. As I have previously
said, I now emphasize again, viz.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Put the People on the Land at
all Costs!</span>&mdash;without which it is impossible, even in Victoria, to
have a large population or prosperity in town or country.</p>

<p>In concluding, I trust this little "Sketch from Life" and personal
experience and advice therein contained, may cause many in the "dear
old land" who are situated as I was, and others, to take heart and
courage, and I doubt not the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> blessing will attend them. They may
have a rough time for a few years, and many ups and downs, but what of
that? Labor with plenty, gives the best health, strength, enjoyment and
longevity. Thus, with a firm trust in the "All-wise" to direct their
path, their feet shall never slip, and they shall cause the "wilderness
to blossom as the rose," and, "by the good hand of God upon them,"
build up a home, as surely as Nehemiah built up Jerusalem, and to cheer
their hearts I will give them a song to sing all along their pilgrim
journey.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
